# word matching cognitive experiment
Overview of the experiment
This experiment was designed to understand how people store and process the meaning of
words, concepts, and objects in their minds. In the experiment, participants are shown a
target word along with three choice words. They are asked to choose which word is most
related to the target. The goal is to measure how words are related in meaning (semantic
association) or how similar they are based on visual features.
Besides semantic meaning, the experiment also includes matching based on visual features
like color, size, texture, and shape. This helps compare semantic processing with
feature-based processing, to see which one is faster and more difficult.
For the semantic condition, there are two levels -
"high" (strongly related) and "low" (weakly
related). The experiment analyzes whether response time is significantly different between
these two levels
